# GitHub Copilot Model Usages

This document provides an overview of the models used by GitHub Copilot and their best applications. GitHub Copilot utilizes models developed by OpenAI, which are specifically fine-tuned for code generation and understanding.

## Codex Models (Underlying Technology)

GitHub Copilot is powered by a family of models known as Codex, which are descendants of OpenAI's GPT models. These models are trained on a massive dataset of public source code from GitHub and other sources, making them exceptionally good at understanding and generating code.

## Copilot Models in Practice

You don't directly choose a specific "Copilot model" in the same way you might choose between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in ChatGPT. Instead, the model is integrated into the Copilot service and is continuously updated by GitHub and OpenAI. However, we can think about its capabilities in terms of different use cases.

### Copilot for Individuals

This is the standard Copilot experience available to individual developers.

**Best for:**
*   **Code Completion and Suggestions:** Autocompleting lines or entire functions in various programming languages. This is its core strength.
*   **Boilerplate Code Generation:** Quickly generating repetitive code, such as class structures, getters/setters, and test stubs.
*   **Learning and Exploration:** Discovering new libraries, APIs, and coding patterns by observing the suggestions it provides.
*   **Translating Languages:** Converting code snippets from one programming language to another.

### Copilot for Business/Enterprise

This version of Copilot offers additional features for organizations, building on the same powerful models.

**Best for:**
*   **Team-wide Productivity:** Enhancing the coding speed and efficiency of an entire development team.
*   **Maintaining Code Consistency:** When combined with organizational best practices, it can help developers adhere to established coding standards.
*   **Onboarding New Developers:** Helping new team members get up to speed with a codebase by providing context-aware suggestions.
*   **Secure and Private AI:** The Enterprise version offers features that ensure code and prompts are not used for training public models, which is crucial for companies with proprietary codebases.

## Summary

The "model" you are using with GitHub Copilot is an advanced, code-specialized AI that is constantly evolving. Its primary and best use is to act as an intelligent pair programmer, accelerating development by handling common and repetitive coding tasks, allowing developers to focus on more complex problem-solving.
